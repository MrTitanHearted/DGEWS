**_DGEWS_** is a simple multithreaded toy windowing system for only learning purposes.

**DGEWS** is an ordinary window manager for only _Windows_ users. It is pretty simple and straightforward so that any one can understand. Indead, my goal is actually to learn the cycle of programming a practical crates and the developement of them.


 It does not aim neither to specialization nor performance. It also has some glitches as well. **_However_**, it is right now in only alpha stage and those errors will be fixed in the near future.
